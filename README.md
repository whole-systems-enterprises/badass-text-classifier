## A badass text classifier based on machine learning

Want to classify celebrity Tweets? Scientific journal abstracts? Movie reviews? Then use this binary classifier to train a deep learning model from your labeled texts to predict labels for unknown text.

## Intense gratitude (credit where it is due)

This work drew heavily on the student work provided at https://github.com/natel9178/CS230-news-bias.

See the "ideological-book-corpus" directory for citations for that dataset.

## Requirements

To train a model, and predict from it, you need:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- MatplotLib

To use the optional "prepare_x_list_from_URL_list" utility, you also need:

- requests
- boilerpipe
